# Experimentalist
This framework provides classes that make it easy to process sound files in custom crafted "experiments". One can use those experiments on a massive scale for all sounds stored in a given directory.

Maybe it is easier to say what this library is not. It is not an another general purpose sound processing library. On the contrary, when crafting experiments, currently available sound processing libraries are used, without focusing on any specific library.

Custom created processing methods are called experiments because their structure is known, but after applying them to many sounds with different content, it is sometimes difficult to predict the effects.

Gather some sounds in one place, write couple of "experiments", apply them on provided souds and just review results.

Prevoiusly in LISP, now in Python.
